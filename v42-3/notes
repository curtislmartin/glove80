== WIP (work in progress) ==

Config:
- Add THUMB_STREAK_DECAY and SPACE_STREAK_DECAY typing streak timeouts for thumb keys.
- Remove obsolete and unused PLAIN_* settings, related to Typing layer.
- Remove USE_NUMPAD_KEYCODES setting; use Lower layer's numpad instead.
- Disable SPACE_FORGIVENESS by default to unblock RGB for Symbol layer.
- Disable WORLD_USE_COMPOSE by default to fix Emoji entry with UnicodeHexInput in macOS.  Thanks to Patrick Roza on Discord for reporting this: https://discord.com/channels/877392805654306816/1193051200938049546/1345832511896424618

Enthium:
- Rearrange punctuation at the cost of increasing LSB% from 0.20% to 0.34% in Cyanophage analyzer while maintaining 0.55% SFB and reducing pinky/ring scissors to 0.34%.
- Put minus on index finger, slash on ring.
- Move backtick and backslash to left thumb cluster T3+T6.
- Move parangs to satellite row, completing the set of all punctuation on the left hand.

Layout:
- Replace traditional shift keys with layer locking access.
- Move layer unlocking to corresponding layer activation key.
- Free up T2 and T3 keys: move T2 keys to T6; Lower to traditional pinky shift keys.
- Add page and scroll up/down on satellite keys for one-handed browsing.
- Use macOS-friendly "Home" and "End" shortcuts in place of Home/End keys on base and cursor layers.

Combos:
- Set C1R5+C2R6 combo for toggling the gaming layer (ditto for the typing layer) to avoid accidental activation during intense gaming sessions.  Thanks to ~gerbilOFdoom on Discord for reporting this issue: https://discord.com/channels/877392805654306816/1193051200938049546/1353030744783716452

- Set T1+T5 combo for CapsLock.
- Set T2+T5 combo for Alt-Tab menu and non-sticky Hyper modifiers.
- Set T5+T6 combo for Ctrl-Tab menu (with Shift-Tab on T1 and Tab on T2) and non-sticky Meh modifiers.

- Make right hand modifiers non-sticky to match semantics of left hand.

Spacegrams:
- Restore space to ring finger and tab to middle finger like v40.
- Consistent vertical stacking of keys: Shift-Tab above Tab.

Cursor/Number/Function:
- Move undo/redo down to satellite row make to room for consistent spacegram operators on upper rows.

Cursor:
- Move left hand undo/redo to pinky lower row for Ctrl-Z familiarity. Thanks to ~Moosy on Discord for this suggestion.
- Remove spacegram operators from right half (only needed on left).
- Balance the need for Undo/Redo access with that of the Spacegrams.
- Add Shift-Tab and Tab surrounding Undo/Redo on right upper row.
- Add Shift-Tab and Tab to thumb cluster for use by Ctrl+Tab combo.

Symbol/Mouse/System:
- Move sticky home row mods to upper row.

Symbol:
- Straddle `[]` inward roll on pinky (upper row) and ring (number row) fingers.
- Cluster continuation marks `,;.` to be inward-rolled from grouping delimiters.

Number:
- Rearrange number row symbols according to "blind" intuition.
- Add `E` for scientific notation in place of `_` underscore.  Thanks to ~FRomano on Discord for requesting this feature: https://discord.com/channels/877392805654306816/1193051200938049546/1343051162685014038
- Move `_` to bottom left corner.
- Stack `,` and `.` vertically to avoid the long reach to T6.  Thanks to ~SebasNadu on Discord for requesting this change: https://discord.com/channels/877392805654306816/1193051200938049546/1343530348730126366
- Move `=` to T6 for a sense of finality and `,` to T1 for proximity to numpad.  This also allows for raking down of `<=` and `>=`.

Emoji:
- Swap ZWJ and skin tone preset keys: ZWJ is now on pinky.
- Move sunrise emojis to the thumb cluster.
- TODO: needs a little more rearrangement to fill gaps.
- Add &nerd_face emoji.

Gaming:

Mouse/Symbol/System:
- Move sticky mods to upper row for ease of access.  Thanks to Patrick Roza on Discord for reporting this issue: https://discord.com/channels/877392805654306816/1193051200938049546/1344596992411701298
